This is an overview of major projects developed at MIPT (DCAM --> DIHT)

##1 term -- DCAM, Ded + intel iLab (2013-2014):
###C (fall):

- Stack machine CPU emulator + custom assembler
- Recursive descent parser syntax analyzer + .dot parse tree vizualizer
- Binary translator to x86 asm
  
###asm (spring):
- asm etudes (NASM, TASM dialects)
- Hashtable testing & optimization (valgrind)
  
##2 term -- DCAM, Lunev + SQL (2014-2015):
###Lunev (fall + spring):
- System V IPC etudes (POSIX, pipes, FIFOs, signals, mutex&shmem etc)
- Unit-testing & code coverage of hashtable project (gcov)
- Parallel & distributed-parallel (through local network communications) numeric computations of integral

###KBT (spring):
- (MS) SQL labs

##3 term -- DIHT, algos + distributed programming (2015-present):
###algos (fall):
- MaxFlow finders based on MKM (3 Indians) and advanced Push-Relabel algorithms
- Suffix structures: Ukkonen's suffix tree builder, suffix array builder based on SA-IS (Induced Sorting) 
- Othello game bot

###distributed (fall):
- Matrix max element computing using POSIX threads, OpenMP and MPI
